music management code to mess with my mpd+mpdcron+beets setup

If you are going to use these, you'll probably have to edit some path variables. 

bran.py is for Beets RANdom, it queries beets for random albums and displays album titles.
If you press enter over an album title 

cli.py is utility scripts or something

music.zsh stores a bunch of alias and functions, some for previously mentioned scripts

ratem.py is an ncurses interface for interacting with mpdcron ratings for songs/albums
cur.py is an ealier version of this
